Efficient supply chain management is necessary to meet customer demands. Demand forecasting is a predictive analysis that estimates how much of a product or service a customer will need in the future. Accurate demand forecasting relies on past sales data and statistical estimates from test markets. Deep neural networks have gained popularity as a demand forecasting technique in supply chain management because of their high level of accuracy.

The objective of this project is to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks with hyperparameter tuning, as well as a hybrid model comprising 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory to predict the demand for eight medicinal drugs.

## Data
The data used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains information on eight medicinal drugs sold over a period of five years. The dataset includes features such as date, sales, and promotional events.

## Models
Two models have been implemented in this project: LSTM and Hybrid 1D CNN-LSTM models.

## Results
Using the MSE and MAPE values to compare the efficiency of both the models, the CNN-LSTM Hybrid Model outperformed the LSTM Model.

## Applications
Demand forecasting has several applications, including inventory control, production planning, and market entry decisions. Accurate forecasting enables businesses to optimize their operations and increase their profitability.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep neural networks, specifically LSTM and hybrid LSTM-1D CNN models, in demand forecasting for supply chain management. The results obtained from this study can be useful for businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory control, production planning, and market entry.
